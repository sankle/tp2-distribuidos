comment,gvlq4zl,2s5ti,meirl,False,1619207030,https://old.reddit.com/r/meirl/comments/mwqoll/meirl/gvlq4zl/,"That comes across as a pretty leading question considering I could show you that anything is ""bad"" for the environment. Even dihydrogen monoxide. As for defending animal agriculture, I'm not sure if that's rhetorical. Of course scientists are going to defend that against misinformation. That's our ethical responsibility whether we're talking about that, climate change denial, anti-vaccine, anti-GMO, etc.

The question that matters more is what happens if we did what is commonly being advocated for. In this case, the most extreme (though unfortunately common one) is to do away with animal agriculture entirely, often relying on completing misleading talking points. There's actually a good paper that looked at [this scenario in the US](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/114/48/E10301.full.pdf). Basically, even that most extreme scenario, you'd only reduce greenhouse gas emissions (in CO2 equivalents) by 2.6% *at best*. I'll mention why I stress at best in a bit.

I mostly like to have students with little background in farming read its methodology first it gives an overview of just how complex the relevant ecology is. Basically, if you scale back livestock production in how it's actually done (rather than the factory farm moniker that gets touted a boogeyman), you lose out on the ecological benefits they provide. I'll paraphrase from a previous post since this is a similar line of discussion.

There are two main parts. One is that livestock occupy grasslands, which are generally not suitable for long-term rowcrop production, but we can harvest grass through livestock. The other is that crops don't magically disappear after one use. Usually, we are extracting human uses first, and livestock get whatever we cannot use between byproducts like distiller's grain and leaf residue. Basically, they use land we cannnot otherwise use (and needs disturbances like grazing to maintain the already endangered ecosystem), and act as recyclers. If someone says most of our crops or land goes to livestock production, that's usually a gross oversimplification.
Basically, [about 86% of the things livestock eat don't compete with human use.](http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/2017_More_Fuel_for_the_Food_Feed.html)

So back to the first paper, what happens when you massive scale back on livestock is that you lose the things they can uniquely do, like maintain grasslands that need disturbances, or consume crop residue we cannot use. We're both taking away food sources from ourselves by reducing them, but also destroying endangered ecosystems like grasslands. The Nature Conservancy had a decent write-up awhile back on this: [Why Canada’s prairies are the world’s most endangered ecosystem](https://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/blog/archive/grasslands-the-most.html)

Scrub trees invade these grasslands after that, and you actually [lose carbon sink capacity by transitioning from grassland to trees](https://climatechange.ucdavis.edu/news/grasslands-more-reliable-carbon-sink-than-trees/) and destroying habitat.

That's just for a quick dump of information that addresses some of the common ecological myths I run into on the internet, but even the size of this reply is an indication of how much people either don't rely on actual data, or don't have the background to really sort through it unfortunately. It's a bit of an example of the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dunning-kruger-effect) at work when it comes to conversations like this, which means people are often even more likely the shut down when presented with information about the subject. It's not any easy one to do education on.",-0.9543,3

There have been some users I’ve seen for a few years where what you described this is exactly their playbook (e.g., cute cow gif that gets a lot of upvotes followed by comments on how could people eat goes, go vegan, etc.). There does seem to be more prominence or an uptick of such posts.

I doubt that’s any concerted effort though by a single organization, just someone engaged in advocacy to an extreme. Unfortunately the uptick in advocacy makes our jobs as scientists harder. Dealing with climate change denial or anti-GMO are hard enough to do some volunteer internet education, but a lot of the subject ignorance or outright anti-science advocacy seems to be transferring over from this subjects and into the livestock end of things. If you thought the myths we have to debunk to get to square one on crops or climate was bad, you should see how bad it gets a “Google University” grad convinced they know what farmers do.",-0.8792,4

It's extremely basic and even if kids aren't much good at it they need to be exposed to the idea earlier to allow it to sink in. I remember 4th grade as ""the writing year,"" where a lot of things were brought together for several enormous (relative to past assignments) writing projects.

Formulas and structures like that are also involved in this problem of the lesson not resembling practical applications which makes it difficult to transition and creates frustration. Outlining was my bane for ages because we weren't writing anything that needed it. I had no idea what it was for and no matter how many times it was explained I didn't understand how to make a good outline.

Part of it is surely my personal learning style but plenty of people hated writing assignments and there are clearly still people who never took those lessons to heart. Rambling, un-formatted, OPs and replies (often interspersed liberally with ellipses) are common. Transitioning from purely conversational language to longer compositions is important but taught ineffectively and late.

It's difficult to cram all the learning into school and do it in a way that works for as many students as possible but my original point is that the small scale example busywork is a terrible way to do that and ends up almost counterproductive due to the way it illustrates concepts poorly, creates frustration and confusion, and misrepresents writing as a baffling set of rules.

I'd rather get more long composition assignments early and have the concepts pointed out later from mistakes and shortcomings using critical thinking questions and editing. In hindsight as I consider this I'm remembering a few instances of that. Those were much more helpful to me.",-0.8386,3
